## Summary

This application allows users to keep a digital catalogue of their gaming journey. The motivation behind building this project was to create a website that allowed users to not only keep a backlog but to also connect with others sharing the same gaming interests. By creating this application, we demonstrated proficiency in collaboration with others as well as in working with React, Vite, MongoDB, GraphQL, Apollo Server, and JWT in a MERN stack application.
